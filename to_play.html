      <h3> Starting Off </h3>   
      <p> Firstly, the field dimensions for ultimate are straightforward. Your field length should be 70 yards, a width of 40 yards, and an endzone depth of about 20 yards. 
      The game is played with seven players a side, for 14 people total on the field. </p>

      <h4> Gameplay </h4>
      <p> The game is played with one Frisbee disc passed around by the seven players on the team. There are no downs or stoppages in time. You can throw the disc in any direction as long
      as your team maintains possession. This means it is a 360 degree game! </p>
      
      <p> If you attempt a throw to a teammate and it is dropped, intercepted, or goes out of bounds, you immediately forfeit possession of the disc and it is a turnover. 
      Time to get on defense! </p>

      <h5> Spirit of the Game </h5>
      <p> In ultimate frisbee, there are not typically many penalties or fouls such as the ones you see in the major sports in the U.S.
      Instead, there is a heavy focus on what's called "Spirit of the Game." What this means is that each player has to demonstrate or show 
      integrity when it comes to certain plays on the field. If there is a jump-ball, or disc, and you get shoved out of the way, it is the 
      responsibility and duty of all players to stop play and assess the foul. </p>
      
      <p> In some cases this type of thing could be referred to as an "unwritten rule" about behavior on the field but in ultimate you would 
      be hard-pressed to find players who don't abide by these. It truly makes for a good spirited game knowing your teammates and even opponents
      will help you out in most situations during the game. </p>
