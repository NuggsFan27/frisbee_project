      <p> It is played with a flying disc, commonly known as a Frisbee, and was first invented in 1968 by a group of students at Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey.
      The game was originally called "ultimate Frisbee football," and the rules were based on those of American football. 
      The first official game of Ultimate was played in 1972, between students at Rutgers University and Princeton University. 
      Over the next few years, the sport spread rapidly throughout the United States and Canada, and the first official tournament was held in 1975, in California.
